# **Hospital Readmissions**
## Author: Varshitha Choudary Vasireddy
## Description of the project:
A hospital readmission is an episode when a patient who had been discharged from a hospital is admitted again within a specified time interval. Readmission rates have increasingly been used as an outcome measure in health services research and as a quality benchmark for health systems. Hospital readmission rates were formally included in reimbursement decisions for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, which penalizes health systems with higher than expected readmission rates through the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program. The real-world clinical care data provided in this competition comes from multiple hospitals across the United States for several years.

## **The challenge: Predict hospital readmissions**
This machine learning project aim is to predict whether or not a patient will be readmitted to the hospital. The target takes on binary values where 0 implies that the patient was not readmitted, and 1 implies that the patient was readmitted.

## **Description of data**

- Diagnosis: The primary diagnosis (coded as first three digits of ICD9); 848 distinct values see http://icd9.chrisendres.com/index.php?action=contents for more information; Nominal
- Number of diagnoses: Number of diagnoses entered to the system; Numeric
- Glucose serum test result: Indicates the range of the result or if the test was not taken. Values: “>200,” “>300,” “normal,” and “none” if not measured; Nominal
- A1c test result: Indicates the range of the result or if the test was not taken. Values: “>8” if the result was greater than 8%, “>7” if the result was greater than 7% but less than 8%, “normal” if the result was less than 7%, and “none” if not measured.; Nominal
- Change of medications: Indicates if there was a change in diabetic medications (either dosage or generic name). Values: “change” and “no change”; Nominal
- Diabetes medications: Indicates if there was any diabetic medication prescribed. Values: “yes” and “no”; Nominal
- 24 features for medications: The feature indicates whether the drug was prescribed or there was a change in the dosage. Values: “up” if the dosage was increased, “down” if the dosage was decreased, “steady” if the dosage did not change, and “no” if the drug was not prescribed; Nominal
- Readmitted: Values: 1 if the patient was readmitted and 0 for no record of readmission.; Nominal

## **Approach Followed**
- Developed an ML model that can perform Binary Classification to predict if a patient with certain attributes like gender, age, etc., will be readmitted in the future.
- Built a data pipeline using R programming that performs Imputation, Factor-levels collapsing, visit-level to patient-level summarization and models based on Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms.
- Models built yielded a LogLoss value of 0.635 which resulted in our team standing at 3rd position in the class kaggle competition.
